**Pads**
+ They refer to the areas on the chip's surface where electrical connections can be made.
+ These pads are typically metalized areas with a specific pattern that allows for the attachment of wires, leads, or other components to create electrical connections.
+ Pads serve as the interface between the internal circuitry of the chip and the external world, such as a printed circuit board (PCB) or other devices.

**Die**
+ It refers to a small, usually rectangular, piece of a semiconductor wafer that contains a single integrated circuit (IC) or microchip.
+ During the manufacturing process, multiple ICs are fabricated on a single semiconductor wafer, and each individual IC is referred to as a "die."
+ After manufacturing, these dies are typically cut from the wafer and then packaged into separate integrated circuits for use in electronic devices.

**Core**
+ It refers to a processing unit within the chip that can independently execute instructions and perform computations.
+ These cores are often referred to as **CPU cores**.
+  A chip may contain one or multiple CPU cores, each capable of running its own set of instructions and performing tasks concurrently.
+  The presence of multiple cores on a single chip is known as **multi-core processing**.

**IPs**
+ It stands for **Intellectual Property** or **IP blocks**.
+ These are pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or components that are often licensed or acquired from third-party companies and integrated into a chip's design.
+ IPs help semiconductor companies save time and resources by incorporating well-tested and specialized functionality into their chips, rather than designing everything from scratch.

**Foundry**
+ It refers to a specialized manufacturing facility that produces semiconductor devices, integrated circuits (ICs), and other microelectronic components on behalf of other companies.
+ These facilities are also commonly known as semiconductor fabrication plants or fabs.

**Macros**
+ They refer to pre-designed and pre-verified blocks of logic or functional circuits that are often used for specific tasks within a chip's design.
+ Macros are similar to Intellectual Property (IP) blocks but are typically larger and more complex.
+ They are used to provide standardized, reusable, and well-optimized functionality within a chip.

<summary> Introduction to RISC-V </summary> 

**ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)**
+ ISA defines the interface between a computer's hardware and its software, specifically how the processor and its components interact with the software instructions that drive the execution of tasks.

**RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - Five)**
+ It is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that has gained significant attention and adoption in the world of computer architecture and semiconductor design.
+ RISC architectures simplify the instruction set by focusing on a smaller set of instructions, each of which can be executed in a single clock cycle. This approach usually leads to faster execution of individual instructions.

+ **Synthesis**
  -  It refers to the process of converting a high-level hardware description into a gate-level representation that can be implemented on a specific hardware technology or semiconductor manufacturing process.
 
+ **Floor and Power Planning**
  - **Chip floor planning** is the process of partitioning the chip die between different system building blocks and place the I/O pads.
  - **Macro floor planning**, also known as block-level floor planning, is a specific aspect of chip floor planning that focuses on the arrangement and organization of large functional blocks or macros within an integrated circuit (IC) design. 
  - **Power planning** also known as power distribution network (PDN) design, focuses on the distribution and management of power and ground connections within the chip. It ensures that all components receive stable power supplies and that power is efficiently distributed throughout the chip.
 
+ **Placment**
  - It refers to the process of determining the physical locations of individual components, such as logic gates, flip-flops, memory cells, and other elements, on the semiconductor die or chip.
  - **Global placement** involves determining approximate positions or locations for major functional blocks, macros, and components on the semiconductor die or chip.
  - **Detailed placement** also known as fine-grained placement, is a critical step in the physical design of integrated circuits (ICs) that follows global placement.
During the detailed placement phase, the positions of individual components, such as logic gates, flip-flops, and memory cells, are determined with high precision within the semiconductor die or chip.

+ **Clock Tree Synthesis**
  - It involves the generation and optimization of a hierarchical tree-like network of clock distribution that ensures synchronized clock signals are delivered efficiently to all flip-flops and other clocked elements within the chip.
  - The primary objectives of clock tree synthesis are to minimize clock skew, reduce clock routing congestion, and meet strict timing requirements.

+ **Routing**
  - It is responsible for establishing the electrical connections (wires or metal traces) that allow signals to flow between different parts of the chip.
  - **Global routing**, also known as channel routing, is the first phase of routing. It determines the general paths for wires that connect different components or blocks on the chip. Global routers aim to minimize the total wirelength while adhering to design rules and constraints.
  - Once the general paths are defined in global routing, detailed routing comes next.
  - **Detailed routing** focuses on individual nets (connections) and determines the specific paths and wires that connect the pins of components or gates. It also resolves any conflicts or overlaps between wires.

+ **Sign-Off**
  - It signifies the point at which a specific design step or aspect has been completed, reviewed, and verified to meet certain criteria or standards.
  - **Physical Verification** sign-off phase covers a range of physical design verification checks, including DRC, LVS, and other manufacturing-oriented checks. It ensures that the design is ready for manufacturing and fabrication.
  - **Timing verification** sign-off specifically focuses on verifying that the chip meets the required timing constraints, such as setup and hold times, clock-to-q delays, and maximum clock frequency. This involves detailed timing analysis and simulation to ensure that the design operates correctly at the specified clock frequencies.

 + **Logic Equivalence Check** (yosys)
   - Everytime the netlist is modified, verification must be performed.
   - LEC is used to formally confirm that the function did not change after modifying the netlist.
  
+ **Dealing with antenna rules violations**
  - When a metal wire segment is fabricated, it can act as an antenna.
  - Reactive ion etching causes charge to accumulate on the wire.
  - Transistor gates can be damaged during fabrication.
  - Two solutions:
    + Bridging attaches a higher layer intermediary.
    + Add antenna diode cell to leak away charges.
  - We took a preventive approach:
    + Add a fake antenna diode next to every cell input after placement.
    + Run the antenna check(**Magic**) on the routed layout
    + If the checker reports a violation on the cell input pin, replace the fake diode cell by a real one.
   
+ **Static Timing Analysis**
  - Static Timing Analysis (STA) is a critical step in the design and verification of integrated circuits (ICs) and other digital systems.
  - It is used to ensure that a digital design meets its required timing constraints and operates correctly within a given clock frequency.
  - STA is performed during the physical design phase of chip development and is crucial for assessing and optimizing the performance and reliability of digital systems.
 
+ **Physical Verification**
  - **LVS (Layout vs Schematic)** is a process that ensures that the physical layout of a chip or circuit matches its intended logical or schematic representation.
  - **DRC (Design Rules Checking)** is a process that ensures that the layout of a chip or circuit adheres to the specific design rules and constraints defined by the semiconductor manufacturing process. 
  - **Magic** is used for design rules checking and SPICE extraction from Layout.
  - **Magic** and **Netgen** are used for LVS
